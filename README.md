I'm Fabien CAYRE. A backend developer, devops engineer, and student in a [French engineering school](https://upssitech.fr/). I'm interested in development (of course!), in games (like Minecraft ❤️) and in finance. I really like doing mini project just to explore some functionalities (Mainly re-inventing the wheel ⚙️).
